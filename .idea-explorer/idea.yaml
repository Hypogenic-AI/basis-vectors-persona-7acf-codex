  title: Basis Vectors in Persona Space
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Persona representations in language models can be decomposed into component
    vectors, and applying PCA to persona vectors derived from documents with diverse
    personas will reveal the most primary components in the residual stream geometry.

    '
  background:
    description: 'Many personas seem to be somewhat linear, in that we can use activation
      steering to encourage them. But surely many of these decompose into the same
      component parts. Can we look at documents with a bunch of different personas,
      find a bunch of persona vectors, and then do PCA to start investigating the
      parts of persona that are most primary in the residual stream geometry?
